The goal of this engine is to make RPG and shooter games in first and third person and in 3D only. The graphics are meant to aim for performance over quality, things like RTX or path tracing are not planned and will most likely not be fully implemented or not at all. Support will be aimed for lower end hardware and higher framerates for a larger audience who can enjoy the games made with this engine so optimization will be very important.

The development of the engine will be split into two major versions - the first test phase where no actual big games will be made, just small test games to try out the capabilities and the second phase which will stay as the main version that will be maintained and upgraded over the years.
