Welcome to the main repository of the Eclipse engine which is a C++ OpenGL engine for RPG and shooter games. This engines main goal is to make games for my game development company Lost Empire Entertainment but it will also stay open source and free to use for anyone else for other purposes.

Libraries used in this engine:
- CMake (alternative to visual studio for generating build files for the engine)
- MinGW (generating the executable)
- GLFW (provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events)
- GLAD (simplifies the process of managing OpenGL function pointers. It generates platform-specific code for loading OpenGL functions, making it easier to use OpenGL in a cross-platform manner)
- GLM (C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification)
- GLTF (supports static models, animation, and moving scenes)
