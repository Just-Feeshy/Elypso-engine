Welcome to the main repository of the Eclipse engine which is a C++ engine for RPG and shooter games in 3D only. This engines goal is to make games for Lost Empire Entertainment as the only main engine and support is planned for Windows only at the current stage. The graphics are meant to aim for performance over quality, things like RTX or path tracing are not planned and will most likely not be implemented at all. Support will be aimed for lower end hardware and higher framerates so that a larger audience can enjoy the games made with this engine.

The development of the engine will be split into two major versions - the first test phase where no actual big games will be made, just small test games to try out the capabilities and the second phase which will stay as the main version that will be maintained and upgraded over the years.
