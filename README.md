Welcome to the main repository of Elypso engine which is an open source C++ OpenGL engine used in Windows. Its main goal will be to make RPG and shooter games and it will be the main game creation engine for my game studio Lost Empire Entertainment once it is production ready.

Libraries used in this engine:
- CMake (alternative to visual studio for generating build files for the engine)
- CPack (configure generators for binary installers and source packages)
- GLFW (provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events)
- GLAD (simplifies the process of managing OpenGL function pointers. It generates platform-specific code for loading OpenGL functions, making it easier to use OpenGL in a cross-platform manner)
- GLM (C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification)
- --Assimp (a library to load various 3d file formats into a shared, in-memory format. It supports more than 40 file formats for import)--
- --Dear ImGUI (bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled applications)--
- --NSIS (windows installer generator)--
- --nlohmann/json (a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate)--

Note: The libraries that are striked out are not yet functional or have not yet been added but they are planned to be added in the near future.
